## Frontend Technlogies

Our website is crafted using React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. React helps us build dynamic and reusable UI components, while JavaScript enables interactive elements. HTML structures our content, CSS adds styling, and Tailwind CSS facilitates rapid, utility-first design. This combination ensures a responsive and visually appealing user experience across all devices
